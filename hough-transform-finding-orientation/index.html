            <h1>Hough Transform for Finding Orientation</h1>
            <p>
                The Hough Transform is a classical computer vision technique used to detect geometric shapes such as
                lines, circles, and ellipses. In this project, we use it specifically to determine the
                <strong>orientation of an object or defect</strong> by detecting the dominant line direction.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Use the Hough Transform?</h2>
            <p>
                The edges or boundary pixels of an object often form elongated patterns. By finding the strongest
                straight line that aligns with these pixels, we can determine the major orientation. The Hough Transform
                allows us to do this by mapping pixels into a parameter space and accumulating evidence for possible
                lines.
            </p>

            <h2>Hough Transform Step-by-Step Approach</h2>
            <p>
                The Hough Transform starts by creating multiple lines in many directions for a single pixel inside the
                defect cluster. For each direction, it computes an angle (θ) and a distance from the origin (ρ). Each
                (ρ, θ) pair receives a vote in the accumulator. When multiple boundary pixels produce the same
                (ρ, θ), the votes accumulate. After all pixels are processed, the pair with the highest votes
                corresponds to the best-fitting line. The angle θ gives the main orientation of the defect.
            </p>

            <h3>Hough Transform — Step-by-Step Explanation</h3>

            <p>
                In the image above, the detailed steps of the process are visualized. The red pixel points represent the
                defect boundary.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each boundary pixel, the algorithm draws straight lines in multiple directions (0°–180°). Each
                    line corresponds to a (ρ, θ) pair stored in the accumulator (Hough space).</li>
                <li>When a green line is drawn, its (ρ, θ) pair is stored and receives its first vote.</li>
                <li>The same process is repeated for the purple line, blue line, and others, each contributing votes to
                    the accumulator.</li>
                <li>After covering all directions for one pixel, the algorithm moves to the next boundary pixel and
                    repeats the process, updating the accumulator.</li>
                <li>If the same blue line appears for another pixel, the accumulator receives another vote for the same
                    (ρ, θ) pair.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This continues for all boundary pixels. The (ρ, θ) pair with the highest vote count represents the most
                consistent line across the defect boundary. This line provides the main orientation relative to the
                x-axis.
            </p>

            <h2>Example: Hough Transform of a Straight Line</h2>
            <img src="hough_line_example.png" alt="Hough Transform Example" class="responsive-image">

            <p>
                In this example, the boundary of a straight line is extracted. Each boundary point maps to a curve in
                Hough space. Curves generated by points lying on the same straight line intersect at a common (ρ, θ),
                forming a peak. The θ value at this intersection corresponds to the detected orientation.
            </p>

            <h2>Orientation Extraction</h2>
            <p>After identifying the strongest (ρ, θ) peak:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>θ</strong> gives the line orientation.</li>
                <li>Horizontal lines → θ = 0°</li>
                <li>Vertical lines → θ = 90°</li>
                <li>Other lines → orientation depends on detected θ</li>
            </ul>
